Rise of Cricket Nation takes into its history. Wherever British had stepped in cricket has risen from that Region. One similarity among allcricketing nations that they would have remained British Colony in their past. British fought 3 wars in Afgh back in 19th century. # INDvAFG;#;
I think we could also introduce Peevers, British Bulldogs and Rounders into the mix. Although we have already become unofficial World #1 ODI Champions having beaten England at cricket last week so Rounders might not make the cut.;#1;
Welcome to test cricket @ ACBofficials. 1st non British colony to play tests. Breaking barriers. # INDvAFG;#;
Granting Wales our own cricket team is like putting the dragon onto the union rag. Why would we want to identify ourselves with anything to do with British colonialism? # DimTîmCricedCymru;#;

# QandA / Pardon me but the idea of cricket as the epitome of loyalty and fair play was a nonce intended to convince the subjects of the British Empire that their rulers were fair minded, which they were not. The English religion was incideousl spread by cricket and afternoon tea.;#;
British Press (Daily Mail) calls SMITH 'Captain Cry-baby'. HAHA that's a new one. It adds extra poetic depth to 'Captain Grumpy' in that 'Captain Cry-baby' is metaphorically ALitterate. # SAvAus # cricket https://www.msn.com/en-au/sport/cricket/captain-cry-baby-no-sympathy-for-steve-smith-from-british-press/ar-AAvgpO4?li=AAgfYrC …pic.twitter.com/UVIglPI6Kr;# #;

# BBC don’t show domestic rugby or cricket, the ashes and other british sports but spend money on showing the # superbowl;# #;
The bowler in # Cricket is always treated unfairly compared to the batsman. Its a colonoal game designed by British keeping themselves as batsman in mind.;#;
