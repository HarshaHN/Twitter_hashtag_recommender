# How the software is organized

- `01_data`: Text files contain large tweets belonging to five different classes. These tweets were scraped from Twitter in millions.

- `02_model`: Recommendation pipeline as described in [model](02_model/model.PNG).

- `03_results`: Obtained performance and project report.

# Usage
1. Open the file '02_model/code.ipynb' on jupyter notebook and simply run the file.
2. TF-IDF top K ranked words is a variable feature size to the model and thus can be thus varied. 

# Keywords
