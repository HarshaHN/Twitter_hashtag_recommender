Day 13 of # 25DaysofTrashmasMovies is “Free Rein: The 12 Neighs of Christmas.” Did I like it? NEIGH. See what I did there? God. Just so many horses. Only good thing about it is that it’s British so at least it’s nice to listen to. 1/10. pic.twitter.com/vOy9umMwmy;#;
Watching something which i enjoy which will ALSO prompt activity. E.g. British re-creation shows like “Edwardian Christmas” which remind me which changes are good, which are sad losses and the amazing things we can do with very little but goodwill. # SlateSpeakhttps://twitter.com/reckshow/status/1073408940124311555 …;#;

# BrexitChaos and John Lewis’ Christmas Ad are top trending. Could anything be more British rn??;#;
British people want us to get it done? At any cost? Surprised no "before Christmas". TBF I do feel for the PM trying to deliver the impossible dream surrounded by criticising cowards on all sides but this deal is a very poor one. No Brexit my current preference. # BrexitDeal;#;
Poor # JohnLewis. They plan for months and release their Christmas advert today, only for the collapse of the British government to upstage them. @ DominicRaab hates Christmas.;#;

I really don’t understand the hate towards the # JohnLewis advert. Not only does it bring together a British institution and icon, it’s also a clinic in filmmaking and makes you think about what Christmas, or more importantly, what gift giving is about. # EltonJohnLewis;# #;
Pantomimes are just a bit of fluff entertainment right? Well did you know that the art of Panto reaches all the way back to ancient Rome?

For decades, most people thought the WWI "Christmas Truce" was a fanciful legend. Then historian Stanley Weintraub dug up dozens of letters British soldiers sent home that were published in local newspapers. Here are my favorites: # Armistice100https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/24/the-christmas-truce-miracle-soldiers-put-down-their-guns-to-sing-carols-and-drink-wine/ …;#;
