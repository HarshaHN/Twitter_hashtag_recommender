Just caught up # bbcqt David Davis. From day 1 negotiating Brexit he's harped on negotiating until the very last minute - that it's the essence of negotiations - deals cut at last minute. He knows that's BS. Only one reason he's said this - no deal. That's all.;#;

"There are too many people who want to subvert the process for their own political interests rather than acting in the national interest." PM May. We had a referendum where one side cheated and won and now it is self-serving to want another one? # Brexit;#;
The # WTO fans want us to forget Europe & go off to become a world superpower on our own then let the EU come crawling to us for a deal, like they haven’t done with China or the USA. That doesn’t fit with compromise or taking some EU rules or backstops. # Brexit;# #;

Is Tony Blair actually being serious when he warns May not to ‘steamroller’ MPs?? He singlehandedly steamrollered the WHOLE country into an unnecessary & unwanted war that had massive ramifications including most of the current refugee & immigrant issues!! Unbelievable!! # Brexit;#;
True. # Blair is providing more opposition to May and # Brexit than # Corbyn. No wonder May is angry with Blair.;# # #;

Leaving is the only option at this stage. Plus if no deal can be agreed then it’s the single biggest reason to leave. Would anyone get married without a being able to ‘leave’? which begs the question - where is the Ombudsman in all of this.. # Brexit;#;

I'm stuck on # brexit. Voted remain (almost toss of a coin), became more of a remainer over time, but now the pendulum is back in the middle. When Blair et al want to stay I worry. When Mogg & Boris want to leave I'm equally concerned. Giz a clue.;#;

Wth Titania? I thought you were progressive. Recognizing any vote that doesn't go your way in any way is NOT progressive. Do not refer to a 3rd vote as the 2nd Referendum. Every # Brexit is the 1st & only until # Remain wins because that will Make Britain Great Again.;# #;

Nothing stops statute except primary legislation. So most options timeout before 29 March 11 pm. 21 Jan 2019 +14 days (Gov must state intentions) = 4 Feb And the 53 days to 29 March 2019 Which means No deal is possible, The deal is possible, everything else impossible. # Brexit;#;

# brexit you cannot argue that another referendum would be undemocratic. The logic of that is that Scotland cannot have a 2nd independence vote. The Brexit vote has left the nation so divided that its MP’s cannot agree on a way forward. Honour democracy and have a peoples vote;#;

We'd demand a refund. The average salary for a MP is £77,379. That's £50,296,350 of tax payers' money annually to pay 650 MPs, & yet they cannot do the job they are paid to do, & want the electorate to do it for them. If we can rule ourselves, why pay £50+ million a year? # Brexit;#;

@ afneil Agreed, nothing undemocratic about a democratic vote. But why can’t MPs make a decision. On average they should be better placed to understand the issues.

Correct. The party is indeed in deep trouble. How could it not be, its failing leadership has enabled a Tory brexit policy that will reduce the living standards of ordinary working people & lead to the loss of worker/citizens rights. Labour must oppose # Brexit in a People's Vote!;#;
Given the current impasse with the backstop, a cross-party commitment to an EFTA/EEA Brexit could well persuade the EU27 to make the necessary concessions on the backstop to allow the WA to pass through Parliament and secure an orderly # Brexit. Otherwise it's 'No Deal'. 2/2;#;

Labour would prefer a General Election but do not rule out a 2nd Referendum, the problem rather is- Labour would not agree with the options that Tory Gov't might give on a 2nd Ref: I.e. Vote for May's Deal or No Deal. Such a 2nd Ref would not be acceptable in its options # Brexit;#;

Any form of Brexit will leave Britain poorer and less influential in the world. # wato;#;
Unfortunately the only option that will restore UK national unity is UK to stay few years without deal outside EU. But this option will destroy UK too. Brexit is NOT about we holding hands and singing kumbaya. It's about UK survival. Trying to save UK we need # PeoplesVote;#;
I looked into my crystal ball and Remoaners are busy preparing for a third referendum FFS # Brexit;#;
May’s deal with the EU is the only one on the table. (There will not be another one, Corbyn). So I find it hard to understand how Brexiteers could vote it down. Once voted down, the only options are: no deal (a mess) or another referendum (which Leavers could lose). # Brexit;#;

Lower standards, in regulations as in living standards, is the ambition of Brexit, is it not? “More competitive in a global market”, that’s what Brexiteers say. Lower standards & a more “flexible” workforce is what they mean. Happy days! # wato;#;

Oh I totally agree with you about Corbyn: a craven midwife to May's bastard Brexit baby. But Blair is simply too divisive a figure to be an effective spokesman for # PeoplesVote, sadly, despite the eminent good sense he talks on the subject.;#;

The logic of a second referendum with these three options is simple and common sense. # 2ndRef # Brexit;# #;
And for people who don't like the deal, and don't like the sound of a 'no deal' exit, either, they can now vote to Remain, when in the past, when they didn't know what the deal was, they might have voted for Brexit.. # Brexit # 2ndRef;# #;
A second, 'three option' # Brexit referendum makes perfect logical sense. We know what the deal is now, which didn't know in 2016. People can for it if they like it. Or, if people still want to Brexit but don't like the deal, they can vote for a 'No deal' Brexit. # 2ndRef;# #;

Given that PM May’s Withdrawal Agreement and a no-deal # Brexit both lack parliamentary support, the only sensible option is a 2nd Referendum asking pubic ‘Remain in EU’ or ‘Exit with/without PM’s WA’.

Can someone tell me definitively how, *if* they won a snap GE, . @ UKLabour would renegotiate a # Brexit *that met all of the EU's own red lines re FOM etc*. I have not yet received a single clear answer to this Q beyond wooly platitudes https://twitter.com/James4Labour/status/1074221668204273664 …;#;
6/ So even though Fox was once a *doctor*, he’s now just a smutty would be *dictator* trying to cling to power for himself and his party, whilst denying it to all the rest of us, and trying to justify it with shoddy reasons that defy any reasonable analysis. # PeoplesVote # Brexit;# #;
5/ His “Constitutional” argument, put another way...”if we give people democracy for # Brexit, we’d have to give them more democracy for Scottish independence too”. Well Liam, *in a democracy* much as you hate it, people should get to vote in fair & legal elections & referendums.;#;
...4/ and in any event, all the indications available to us are that the growing majority of Britons now say # Brexit is *wrong*. How can it be democratic to force through something people no longer want, because of an illegally fought referendum in 2016? pic.twitter.com/9rC4ikN8ij;#;

"Societies survive by adaptation, rejecting orthodoxy and embracing change" says John Yorke in Into The Woods, writing about the psychology of storytelling. Ardent Brexiteers are embracing this. Our chosen story empowers us. But I firmly believe the hopes of # Brexit are mythical.;#;
Superb line of questioning from @ christopherhope on @ brexitbroadcast. @ Keir_Starmer, Labour’s # Brexit Secretary absolutely floundering and unable to answer a single question directly. Pretty damning. Worth a listen.;#;

Lol, # Brexit happened BECAUSE there was no way to “treat” the many issues that any rational country’s populace would have. The EU was set up to *prevent* this kind of democratic interference with European governance. Where’s a “redress of grievances” in the EU charter?;#;

So @ AlexChalkChelt you’re probably bored of people tweeting you about # brexit but unfortunately it’s the most important issue for a generation. As it now looks likely that there will be a # peoplesvote - will you vote in parliament to ensure that Remain is an option on the ballot?;# #;
# Brexit would be hard for Britain. Staying in the E.U. would be worse. interesting opinion from @ henryolsenEPPC @ washingtonpost.

My winning Leave vote in 2016 was not cast so that the UK could do a deal which keeps an 'entwined economy' with the EU. It was to create a UK which is independent and free of the EU via a full clean exit. # Brexit;#;

Reality of # NoDeal # Brexit is: 1) NO cliff edge, it's rhetoric without fact. 2) Firms hitting problems simply failed to prepare, arrogantly assuming vote would be overturned. 3) Problems at ports would be simply because EU were playing sillybuggers. So why should WE have to wait?;# #;

So essentially what you’re saying is that people regardless of public standing, should only be allowed to change their mind if they want change from leave to remain? I voted remain in the referendum, now having seen what way the EU operate, I would 100% vote leave now # Brexit;#;
May says MPs cannot "abdicate responsibility" to deliver Brexit by holding # PeoplesVoteNow. But she is in contempt of Parliament. She abdicated her responsibilities. "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye.";#;

Maybe because the DUP hold 10 seats out of over 600 and have no right to tell the UK what to do as long as they deny British citizens basic British rights like marriage equality. Soon the children will be back in the curious corner, their race run. # Brexit # BrexitVote;# #;

These are the people leading our country at the moment, they also say if Brexit were to be stopped then they'll never vote again. For me this is the strongest argument to # StopBrexit;#;

Why not put a 5 year time limit on the backstop? Pay the 37 billion now, but if no trade deal in 5 years, hard Brexit. That’s a good deal for the EU, and it solves our problem. It’s also an incentive to both parties to sort out a deal. # BACKSTOP;#;

With honest Government we could hold a series of ‘town hall meetings’ consulting people over the next two years to clarify a better way forward and/or run regional ballots to gauge the issues. We’ll be talking # Brexit anyway so why not?;#;

No withdrawal agreement can meet Labour's six tests Ms Thornberry, because they're for a trade deal. No Brexit can meet Labour's six tests because of the "exact same benefits" test. Freedom of movement is one of those "exact same benefits". The tests are dishonest. # marr;#;

# PeoplesVote There’s a way to get three questions in the referendum, without splitting the Brexit vote. A basic three questions - Hard, Soft, Remain. To decide the IN/OUT issue, HARD and SOFT are added together v REMAIN. Then for HARD/SOFT, most votes wins. One vote, two answers.;#;
