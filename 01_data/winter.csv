The fieldfare is a migratory bird that visits British farmland to search for food in the autumn. Variously known as Felfit, Felfer, Felfaw, Fildifire across the regions. If it arrives on our shores early it is thought to presage an early or severe winter. # FolkloreThursdaypic.twitter.com/rAKRgjDWz4;#;

The British press really are a disgusting group of organisations. They love destroying people in the papers and TV. Henry Winter is vile also. # ImpossibleJob;#;

Enjoyed # ImpossibleJob but Henry Winter is seemingly oblivious to the press’ role in England’s downfall and projects his own feelings onto the whole nation. Why he’s so revered amongst the British press is beyond me. Capello very interesting though;#;
Henry Winter is everything that is wrong with the British media. # impossiblejob;#;
